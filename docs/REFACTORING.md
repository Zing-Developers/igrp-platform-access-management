## 1. Access Control Rules

1. **Department (Top-level access)**

   * Departments are the top unit of access.
   * Departments can have **child departments** (recursive hierarchy).
   * **Rule:** A child department can only access applications, menus and resources that its parent department already has access to.
   * **Example:** If Department Finance has access to Application Finance, then a child department (e.g., Payroll Department) can inherit access but cannot access Application Logistics unless Finance already has access.

2. **Applications**

   * Applications belong to none, one or more departments.
   * An application contains **menus** and **resources**.
   * Access to an application is controlled by **both department and role**.
   * **Example:** Application Finance can be linked to Department Finance and Department IT. Users in IT with the right roles can access Application Finance menus and resources.

3. **Menus**

   * Menus are **role-based access only**.
   * A user must have a role linked to the menu to see it.
   * **Example:** Menu Salaries is linked to the "HR Manager" role. Only users with that role will see the Salaries menu in the app.

4. **Resources**

   * Resources are automatically synced on server startup
   * Resources are created independently, and later they can be associated with applications.
   * Frontend Resources contains **Resource Items** (e.g., page routes).
   * Backend Resources contains the permissions to access APIs.
   * Resource access is **controlled by both roles and permissions**.
   * **Example:** A Resource Item "Salary List" can be accessed if the user has the "HR Manager" role **and/or** the "View Salary" permission.

5. **Roles**

   * Roles are **department-specific** (a role cannot belong to multiple departments).
   * Roles contain:
      * **Multiple permissions**
      * **Multiple users**
   * Users can have **multiple roles**.
   * Roles can be hierarchical (recursive).
   * **Rule:** A child role can only be given permissions and users that the parent role already has access to.
   * **Example:** Role "Finance Manager" may have a child role "Junior Accountant." Junior Accountant can only inherit permissions that Finance Manager has, not create new ones outside.

6. **Permissions**

   * Permissions are synced on server startup.
   * Permissions are created **in-code only** by the developer in microservices projects, and later they can be associated with resources and roles.
   * Permissions can exist independently or be linked to a resource or role (or both).
   * Permissions can be checked:
      * Directly against a resource item (ABAC check)
      * Or indirectly, through roles a user holds.
   * **Example:** Permission "View Budget" is linked to Resource Item "Budget Report". If the user’s role has this permission, they can access that resource.

7. **Users**

   * A user is assigned one or more roles.
   * Through roles, a user inherits the **permissions** of that role.
   * **Example:** User Alice has roles "Finance Manager" and "Project Approver." She can see menus for both roles and access resources permitted by both.

```

### Example Use Cases

1. **Menu Access (RBAC only)**

   * Alice has Role Finance Manager (RFM).
   * RFM is linked to Menu Salaries (MS).
   * ✅ Alice sees the Salaries menu.
   * ❌ Bob, without RFM, won’t see it.

2. **Resource Access (RBAC + Permission)**

   * Charlie has Role IT Support (RIT).
   * RIT is linked to Resource Item Budget Report (IB) via Permission View Budget (PB).
   * ✅ Charlie can access Budget Report API.
   * ❌ David (Junior Accountant) cannot, since his role doesn’t inherit PB.

3. **Department Hierarchy**

   * Department IT (DIT) has access to Finance Application.
   * Payroll (child department of Finance) can only inherit applications/resources/menus that Finance already has.
   * ✅ Payroll gets Finance App menus if the parent has access.
   * ❌ Payroll cannot request Logistics App directly.

## 4. Model Changes

To support **sharing + recursive inheritance**:

---

### **DepartmentEntity**

* Must handle **owned vs shared elements**.
* New join tables:

   * `t_department_application`
   * `t_department_menu`
   * `t_department_resource`
* Add flags:

```java
@Column(name = "shared_from")
private Integer sharedFromDepartmentId; // points to the department that shared this access
```

---

### **ApplicationEntity**

* Still belongs to one department originally (owner).
* But can be linked to multiple via `t_department_application` (departments).

```java
@ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
@JoinTable(
        name = "t_department_application",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "application_id"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
)
private Set<DepartmentEntity> departments = new HashSet<>();

@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "owner_department_id", nullable = false)
private DepartmentEntity ownerDepartment;
```

---

### **MenuEntryEntity**

* Must be linked to roles.
* Add sharing link:

```java
@ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
@JoinTable(
    name = "t_menu_entry_role",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "menu_entry_id"),
    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "role_id")
)
private Set<RoleEntity> roles = new HashSet<>();

@ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
@JoinTable(
    name = "t_department_menu",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "menu_id"),
    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
)
private Set<DepartmentEntity> departments = new HashSet<>();
```

---

### **ResourceItemEntity**

* Role + permission already defined.
* Add sharing to departments:

```java
@ManyToMany
@JoinTable(
    name = "t_department_resource",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "resource_item_id"),
    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
)
private Set<DepartmentEntity> departments = new HashSet<>();
```

---

### **RoleEntity**

* Department-specific.
* Recursive parent-child.
* New inheritance rule enforcement at service level:

   * Child role: can create new permissions → propagate upward.
   * Parent role: permissions cascade downward unless explicitly excluded.

### Availability Data

**Departments**

* **Fetch applications that a department can use OR attribute:**

   * Usage: apps already linked.
   * Attribution: apps shared through menus/resources of parent departments or other departments.
* **Endpoint:**

  ```
  GET /departments/{id}/applications/available
  ```

        "code": "LOG_APP",
        "ownedBy": "Logistics",
        "sharedFrom": "IT"
      }
   ]
  ```

**Menus**

* **List menus that can be attributed to a department:**

   * Must respect:

      * If the parent department has the application → children can attribute menus of that app.
      * If the application is shared through another department, those menus become available.
* **Endpoint:**

  ```
  GET /departments/{id}/menus/available
  ```
* **Response Example:**

  ```json
  [
      { "id": 100, "name": "Salaries", "application": "Finance", "sharedFrom": "Finance" },
      { "id": 101, "name": "Reports", "application": "Finance", "sharedFrom": "IT" }
  ]
  ```

---

**Resources**

* **List resource items a department can attribute:**

   * Based on parent department’s access.
   * Respect recursive inheritance.
* **Endpoint:**

  ```
  GET /departments/{id}/resources/available
  ```
* **Response Example:**

  ```json
  [
      { "id": 200, "name": "Salary List", "permission": "ViewSalary", "sharedFrom": "Finance" },
      { "id": 201, "name": "Budget Report", "permission": "ViewBudget", "sharedFrom": "IT" }

  ```

  ```json
  [
      { "id": 300, "name": "GPT", "fromParent": true },

## Migration Strategy

1. **Database Migration**:
    - Add new columns with default values
    - Backfill data from relationships
    - Phase out old columns

2. **API Versioning**:
    - Maintain v1 endpoints during transition
    - Introduce v2 with new patterns
    - Deprecate v1 after full migration
